Dear Sir,

As a mobile developer who has had nearly 10 years of experience in working with mobile applications, I would love to be able to work with you to develop this application that you're trying to create. My experience aligns well with what you may require. I have worked as a Software Engineer on mobile applications for health insurance, industrial engineering, and consumer based applications. 

With my experience in the tech sector I believe that I would be a great fit to work with you on this to develop the application. I am familiar with xamarin, iOS, and Android; I have also learned from my years of experience software engineering techniques to create a maintainable application that can be developed on by other engineers with knowledge of basic software engineering principals. This application will be easily maintained by future software engineers as mobile device requirements change.

Please review my attached resume to review past employments and achievements. I appreciate your time and look forward to your response. 

Thanks

- Frank Hu
